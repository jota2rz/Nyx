/**
 * DSTM-aware beacon client for inter-server migration data transfer.
 *
 * Extends AMultiServerBeaconClient with RPCs that carry serialized
 * FRemoteObjectData between game servers. This is the network transport
 * layer that replaces DSTM's default disk I/O with beacon-based delivery.
 *
 * Architecture (SEAMLESS.md, Approach 2, Step 3):
 *   When Server-A calls TransferObjectOwnershipToRemoteServer(), the engine
 *   serializes the actor and invokes RemoteObjectTransferDelegate. Our
 *   DSTMSubsystem catches this, serializes FRemoteObjectData to bytes,
 *   and sends it to Server-B via this beacon's ServerReceiveMigratedObject().
 *
 *   Server-B receives the data, deserializes it, and feeds it into
 *   OnObjectDataReceived() — the engine's DSTM receive pipeline handles
 *   the rest (PostMigrate, connection rebind, etc.).
 *
 * The beacon mesh uses SetUnlimitedBunchSizeAllowed(true) (inherited from
 * AMultiServerBeaconClient), so serialized payloads can exceed the default
 * 64KB reliable RPC limit.
